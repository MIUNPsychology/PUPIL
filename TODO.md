# TODO

These are things which need to be fixed before a release


## Missing features

* Cannot create a new teacher 
* Cannot change password for an existing teacher
* Need to have config file for database connection (i.e not hard code it)
* All source files should have license header (which license anyway?)

There are some things which would really improve the user experience too:

* Ability to batch import a comma-separated values with students 
* Ability to batch add student permissions to an experiment

Or, in the best of worlds:

* Replace the entire teacher interface with a modern javascript-based one.

## Docs

* Are the old docs available anywhere?
* Include license file in build
* Write basic homepage about usage

## Deprecated functionality 

* Remove MIUN-specific student database calls

## System setup

* Clean up SQL scripts (i.e, don't insert MIUN-specific data)

## Build/distribution

* Copy/create appropriate license files for all dependencies
* Make zip files available for download somewhere
