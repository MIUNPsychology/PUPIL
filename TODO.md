# TODO

These are things which need to be fixed before a release

## Missing features

* All source files should have license header (which license anyway?)

There are some things which would really improve the user experience too:

* Ability to batch import a comma-separated values with students 
* Ability to batch add student permissions to an experiment
* Ability to import/export entire projects (this would be crucial if we intend for people to be able to share their experiments)

Or, in the best of worlds:

* Replace the entire teacher interface with a modern javascript-based one.

## Docs

* Include license file in build
* Convert the current PDF-based documentation to wiki format (probably on github)

## Deprecated functionality 

* Remove MIUN-specific student database calls

## Build/distribution

* Copy/create appropriate license files for all dependencies
* Make zip files available for download via an official homepage rather its temporary location
